Parser for Facebook Marketplace HTML output to assist me in buying a car

In order to avoid having my house targeted by a Metaâ„¢ Airstrike, this scraper works by manually scrolling through the "Autos" page on Facebook until you reach the end, and then saving the page HTML and loading it into the program. It sounds stupid (because it is), but this isn't actually a program meant to be used by anybody but me. In full transparency, I'm only posting it on here because I need version control between my laptop (in my hometown during the holidays) and my PC (at my actual home). If you manage to find this code useful, please contact me and I will send you a prize.
